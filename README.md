# Human_rDNA
## Problem: Fewer work has been done to associate known diseases to the Human rDNA due to it's unique characteristics. 
## 1.Build a detailed sound profile of the Human rDNA (1000 Genome Project)
### Reference index
```sh
bash hg_index.sh
```
### Pipeline Wrapper(download, alignment, index, sort, variant calling)
```sh
bash runthis.sh
```
## 2. Apply what we learned about the Human rDNA profile into Patient EHR, Physical Assessment and Survey Data(All of Us)
```sh
example.sh
```
